    Usage: display_cmd_info

     This command displays the name and arguments of the command provided
     in the 'myargv' array. The first element is considered the command name,
     while subsequent elements are treated as arguments.
     
     If there are no additional arguments, it will print "No arguments".
     If 'myargc' is zero, indicating no command and arguments, it will state
     that no command name or arguments were provided.
